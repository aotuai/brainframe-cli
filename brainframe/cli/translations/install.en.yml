    Installs the BrainFrame server. Most users will be able to run
    this command without worrying about the flags. You will be prompted for
    each configuration option interactively.


    Alternatively, all configuration can be provided using flags instead. If
    any flags are provided, the command will no longer run interactively. This
    is useful when using this command in a script as part of an automated
    deployment.
  usage: "brainframe install [<args>]"
  thanks: >-
    Thanks for using BrainFrame! This installer will handle downloading and
    setting up the server.

    This installer can also be configured non-interactively with flags. Run
    "brainframe install -h" for details.
